# latexify

Any time your clipboard contains text that starts with `[latex]`, this tool will:
1. Render the clipboard contents inserted into a LaTeX a document
2. Place the resulting image in your clipboard
3. Paste it and press Enter

This is meant to be used with Discord, as it (still) doesn't support LaTeX

You can also put `[main]` somewhere in the text. Everything before it will go into the preamble, and everything after will land in the document body
